```

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Starting the Application

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd Frontend/ShortGunFrontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Game Flow

1. **Entry Screen**
   - Choose to create a new room or join existing one
   - Enter your name and room code (if joining)
   - Connection status indicator shows real-time status

2. **Waiting Room**
   - Share room code with friends
   - Host can start the game when 2+ players join
   - Real-time participant list with ready indicators

3. **Selection Phase**
   - Take turns selecting cricket players (10-second timer)
   - View available players with ratings and roles
   - Track your team building progress
   - Real-time updates when others pick

4. **Results Screen**
   - Final leaderboard with team scores
   - Detailed team composition view
   - Export results to CSV
   - Play again functionality

## 🎨 Visual Design Elements

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep blues and purples (neuroscience-inspired)
- **Accents**: Emerald green for success states
- **Warnings**: Amber for attention states
- **Errors**: Red for error states
- **Backgrounds**: Gradient overlays with glass-morphism

### Typography
- **Headers**: Bold, clean sans-serif
- **Body**: Medium weight for readability
- **UI Text**: Light weight for subtle information

### Animations
- **Neural Pulse**: Breathing effect for important elements
- **Synaptic Flow**: Flowing gradients for loading states
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects and state transitions
- **Real-time Indicators**: Pulse effects for live data

## 🔌 Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with your existing Socket.IO backend and handles these events:

### Emitted Events
- `join-room` - Join or create a room
- `start-selection` - Host starts the game
- `select-player` - Player makes a selection

### Listened Events
- `room-update` - Participant list updates
- `turn-order` - Game starts with turn order
- `your-turn` - Player's turn notification
- `player-selected` - Someone selected a player
- `auto-selected` - Auto-selection occurred
- `selection-ended` - Game completed

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# The dist/ folder can be deployed to any static hosting service
# like Vercel, Netlify, or served by your backend
```

## 🧠 Neuroscience UI Principles Applied

1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**
   - Minimal interface with clear hierarchy
   - Grouped related information
   - Progressive disclosure of details

2. **Visual Processing Optimization**
   - High contrast for important elements
   - Consistent spacing and alignment
   - Predictable interaction patterns

3. **Neural Metaphors**
   - Network-like connection patterns
   - Pulse animations mimicking neural activity
   - Flow states represented visually

4. **Attention Management**
   - Strategic use of color and motion
   - Clear focus indicators
   - Reduced visual noise

## 📱 Responsive Design

The interface adapts seamlessly across devices:
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with multi-column layouts
- **Tablet**: Optimized touch targets and spacing
- **Mobile**: Stacked layouts with gesture-friendly controls

## 🔧 Customization

To customize the UI:

1. **Colors**: Modify the Tailwind config or CSS variables
2. **Animations**: Edit the CSS animations in `index.css`
3. **Player Data**: Update `src/data/players.js` for different sports
4. **Socket Events**: Modify event handlers in `App.jsx`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**
   - Check backend server is running on port 5000
   - Verify CORS settings allow frontend origin
   - Check browser network tab for WebSocket errors

2. **State Sync Issues**
   - Refresh the page to reset state
   - Check browser console for Socket.IO errors
   - Verify event names match between frontend/backend

3. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Clear browser cache if styles look broken
   - Check if Tailwind CSS is loading properly
   - Verify all components are importing correctly
